# Guide for making your first-ever contribution

## Congratulations on taking your first step towards becoming an open-source contributor ðŸš€

I'm thrilled to have you join the community of enthusiastic developers. This repository is designed with you in mind, offering a friendly and approachable way to make your first open-source contribution. It's a fantastic opportunity to learn, collaborate, and grow your skills while contributing to real-world projects.

### Steps to add yourself to the contributors list

1) You will first need git which you can download from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

2) Now head [here](https://github.com/tanishkamakode/First-Contribution-to-Open-source) and click on the `fork` button.

3) On the next page you will see a `create fork` button, press it.

4) You will land on your forked repo page, here you will see a `<> Code` button marked in green, click on it and copy the url.

5) Open your terminal, type git clone <url you copied> and press enter.

6) Now you will see a folder named `Welcome-to-Open-Source`, open it and edit the `README.md` file using any text editor, VScode for example.

7) Below is a code snippet for reference as to what has to ADDED in the file. Inside the `<b> </b>` tag you have to put your name, in the `<href >` tag, you have to place your github profile URL. And lastly you have to place your github profile photo url inside the `src` tag.

   ```

       </a>
   </td>
   ```

8) Now save your changes and exit the editor, type `git add .`, afterwards `git commit -m "<your name> âœ¨"` and lastly `git push origin master`.

9) Go to your forked repo page, `sync` your fork and then there you will see a button in green which says `Open pull request`, press it and in the comments section type "Adding my name to contributor list" and press on `create pull request`.

10) You have created a pull request, wait for me to review and merge it : )
